<h3>Problem Solver:</h3>
<p>Logic, patience, communication, and attention to detail are my underlying strengths. I have a knack for not panicking in the face of complexity. I break problems down into manageable chunks and tackle them with the tools at my disposal.</p>

<h3>Things I’m into:</h3>
</p>Planning, building structures, thinking in systems, puzzles, adapting to change, and learning new technologies.</p>

<p>🥋Fun Fact: I worked on a TV show with Chuck Norris. Seriously, I did.</p>
