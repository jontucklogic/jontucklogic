Problem Solver:
Logic, patience, communication, and attention to detail are my underlying strengths. I have a knack for not panicking in the face of complexity. I break problems down into manageable chunks and tackle them with the tools at my disposal.

Things Iâ€™m into:
Planning, building structures, thinking in systems, puzzles, adapting to change, and learning new technologies. 

ðŸ¥‹Fun Fact: I worked on a TV show with Chuck Norris. Seriously, I did.
