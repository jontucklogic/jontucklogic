<strong>Problem Solver:</strong>
Logic, patience, communication, and attention to detail are my underlying strengths. I have a knack for not panicking in the face of complexity. I break problems down into manageable chunks and tackle them with the tools at my disposal.

<strong>Things I’m into:</strong>
Planning, building structures, thinking in systems, puzzles, adapting to change, and learning new technologies. 

🥋Fun Fact: I worked on a TV show with Chuck Norris. Seriously, I did.
